I’m sure you’ve seen the photos on social media of ordinary people in HazMat suits, the empty store shelves that once held toilet paper, and people fighting over hand sanitizer. People do strange things when they feel helpless and their world feels out of control. Some do the things I just mentioned, others are paralyzed with fear and others don’t want to deal with proven facts and think that this virus was bioengineered, funded by an American foundation that used a Chinese lab to disperse it. Only time will tell with that theory. I always thought that the only way that this world would come together would be from an outside threat. One that didn’t care what about one’s religion, gender or ethnicity, they just wanted to destroy the human race. Aliens? A gigantic asteroid? If you’ve seen the movie “Armageddon” you are familiar with the plot. At this very moment, we have a disease that doesn’t discriminate, we are still learning about the mode of transmission, and we don’t have a vaccine or cure. This situation should accentuate our common humanity. It should bring all of us together regardless of differing opinions and lifestyles. It will be disheartening if not a tragic scenario if it doesn’t.      

We are all in this together. We need each other. We can sequester ourselves for the time being until we know more about this disease, but we can still be social. We need to be social, we are a social species. We can use this time to build stronger relationships with our family. We are fortunate to live in a time with video chatting so we can still see each other and diminish our anxiety and loneliness that may begin to consume us. It’s hard when we can’t touch each other. Even if we feel helpless we still have control over our lives and must remind ourselves of those things that we can control. We can implement the protocols that the CDC has administered. We can help those who are in a high-risk group by delivering groceries to them and leaving them on their porch and keeping in frequent contact with them.      

My mother was telling me that this pandemic reminded her of how scared everyone was during the polio epidemic. We will get through this. It will take patience, trust, and fortitude. There is only one thing that bothers me. If we do unite and get through this, how soon will it be before we become divided again because of our differences? It will be sooner rather than later. If this happens then we haven’t learned from this pandemic at all. 

Stay safe and healthy!
