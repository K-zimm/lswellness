I went to a party recently. The hostess wasn’t very good at her job, always complaining about how things didn’t turn out the way she had planned and apologizing for not getting it “quite right.” Have you ever been to a party like this? Well, I have a confession to make. The hostess was me and the party was a “pity party.” I have found that it’s alright to feel disappointed about my health once and awhile, I shouldn’t deny my feelings. I need to work THROUGH them. The best remedy I have found is to have an Attitude of Gratitude. When I start listing everything going right in my life as opposed to everything going wrong, well, it’s a pretty darn long list and it lifts me right out of my funk. What are you thankful for today?

Have a wonderful week!
