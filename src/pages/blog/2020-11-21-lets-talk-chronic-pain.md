I have lived with chronic pain for the last 25 years. First, with chronic migraines and now chronic joint pain. I used to have migraines five out of seven days of the week. It was hell, not only on me but on my marriage. My health was the primary reason but not the only reason for the demise of my marriage. My migraines have waxed and waned over the years, and joint pain has been added to the mix. I have my good days and bad days, but this week was awful. 

Over the years, I’ve learned that surrendering to the pain while in the throes of it isn’t bad. It doesn’t make me a weak person. I need to surrender so that I can begin to recover. It’s taught me to listen to my body, heal on my terms, and not compare myself to others. When I FEEL that I can’t do anything, I try to think of something that I can do. I can watch TV, meditate, read, listen to a podcast, write, sleep. And I remind myself that I am doing exactly what I need to do. I am recovering.

Stay safe, stay healthy, and keep the faith!
