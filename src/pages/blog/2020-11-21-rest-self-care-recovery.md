I hate being in a flare. This is day #3. Waking up with a headache and as the morning progressed every joint hurts. I will spend my afternoon in bed just so I can get up and make dinner. Autoimmune disease is tough and I’m lucky that this doesn’t happen all of the time. I remember when I would have migraines and joint pain 5 to 7 days out of the week. I didn’t have time to be mad at the situation because I was trying to care for two small children. I was more depressed than anything. Now I get mad when I’m forced to rest but I try to do something constructive. Sleep, pray, meditate, read or watch a funny movie. Laughter truly is the best medicine. Flare days are rough but rest = recovery.
