Stepping out of your comfort zone is daring, nerve-racking, and refreshing. I did just that when I sang for Dancing with the QC Stars a couple of weeks ago. I haven’t sung for an audience in over 20 years. I only thought about that when I was asked about it. It felt as if I’d never stepped away from it!

The reason I haven’t performed for a great while was because life got in the way. Marriage, kids, health issues, everyday stuff. I have a B.A. in Music with a concentration in Vocal Performance. It felt so good to plan, practice and prepare for this performance! I didn’t realize how much I miss performing until that evening when it was over. Applause can be intoxicating! I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I would be. I knew my material and had faith in my accompanist and the rest I left in God’s hands. I knew that I could only control so much and what was going to happen was going to happen. I was at peace with that. 

Sharing your talents is not only a gift for others but a gift for you. Seeing others enjoying your work is inspiring and nurturing for your soul. Music and help sooth and heal the audience as well as the performer. I sang Christmas carols this evening with a group singers from Connection Quad Cities Church for those in long term hospital care. The patients, families, and nurses were touched that we were there. We didn’t sound like professional singers but every note was sung with joy, empathy, and love. Step out of your comfort zone, you never know what it may lead to!
