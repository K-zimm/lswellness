I was surfing the web and came across an article about The Players Workshop, a school of improvisation in Chicago. They offer a free online workshop for teachers, teaching them improvision exercises to use with their students to help them better communicate, focus, and engage in the virtual classroom. There was a quote by actress, Bonnie Hunt, about The Players Workshop, “I’m forever grateful for all I gained from the Players Workshop experience – so many life-enhancing skills, like listening, observing, teamwork, confidence, slowing down yet thinking fast, the value of every idea, and the joy of observing and celebrating all the characters in your life.” 1     

The value of every idea. I like that. How many times have we dismissed an idea because we think it’s stupid or think it’s a great idea but have no idea how to accomplish it? It can’t be any good if we don’t even know where to begin. What if I’m the only one who believes in the idea and everyone else is dismissive and can’t see my vision. It must be a dumb idea if no one else can conceptualize it. Wrong!    

Have you seen the movie “Under the Tuscan Sun?” It is one of my favorite movies. It takes place in my favorite place in the world (so far), Tuscany, Italy. This is one of the reasons it is one of my favorites. Another reason is the storyline about the young, blond-haired, blue-eyed male Polish worker who falls in love and marries the brunette, brown-eyed, Italian young lady who lives next door to the home he’s helping renovate. They remind me of my parents, my Polish father and Italian mother, in fact, they even look like my parents. There is a scene that helps me when I have an idea and get stuck taking that first step. The movie opens with a writer speaking at a celebration at a bookshop because he published his first book. He thanks his writing professor, Frances, and says, “…What I meant to say was, when I took her class at State, I had the worse case of writer’s block in the world. All I had were terrible ideas. I hated them all. I was just about to drop the class when she said something to me that changed everything. She said, “Terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats. Given the right encouragement, they grow up to become geniuses.” She told me to take one of my terrible ideas and work on it. Well…I did.”2     

Terrible ideas have value too and they can have more value than you can imagine. There are ideas I have that to me seem impossible to accomplish but I ask God and the saints for their help. Some people will put it out there and ask the Universe for help. They see the whole picture while we only see a portion of it. They see all the moving pieces. Don’t talk yourself out of creating something just because you don’t know how it will happen.      

Maybe you need something Herculean to make that idea happen. That’s a terrible idea, it will never happen. Play with it, pretend you have what you need…what it the next step and on and on. Now, let’s break down into small steps on how to get that Herculean thing that you need. Sometimes thinking about that terrible idea will lead you to a remarkable one. Bonnie is right; every idea has value, even the terrible ones. Take a terrible idea and work on it this week.

Stay healthy, stay safe, and keep the faith!
