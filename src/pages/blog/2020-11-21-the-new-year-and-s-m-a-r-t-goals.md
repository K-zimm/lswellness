The New Year and S.M.A.R.T Goals

You know that saying, “If you fail to prepare, than prepare to fail?” Well, it’s true. While we are on the road to fulfill our dreams, we need directions, we need support in case something goes wrong or maybe the road is a long one. So, what do we do? We make goals, but we have to make particular goals. If we say that “I would like to lose 20 pounds in 2020,” that isn’t a goal. That is well wishing. It’s vague. If we say “I would like to lose 10 pounds in 6 months,” that’s a little better. If we say, “I would like to lose 10 pounds by July 1, 2020,” that is much improved. Making S.M.A.R.T. goals is key to staying on that road and not taking a detour.

S.M.A.R.T goals are **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant and **T**imely. Each goal should have these qualities. Being specific helps your focus and you know exactly what you are setting out to do. They must be measurable. When you can see your progress you are apt to keep going and concrete numbers show you that you are getting closer to your goal. Have an achievable goal by asking yourself if this goal is even realistic or is it too pie-in-the-sky? Is your goal relevant to your life or business? Give yourself a specific amount of time to achieve it. Time is a motivator and also helps your focus. 

We might start on that road to a dream and breaking down our S.M.A.R.T. goals into smaller and smaller S.M.A.R.T. goals helps us not get overwhelmed and get to our destination.

Happy New Year and Happy achievements this YEAR!
