*Epictetus said, “There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things that are beyond the power of our will.”*

Are you happy all of the time? We are constantly being told that we should be happy all of the time. If we aren’t than something is wrong with us. There is a big industry out there that helps you find happiness. Some of it is good and some of it is bad.

The bad part is the part that tells you that you have to be a certain size, drive a certain car, have a particular size house, use a certain brand of shampoo to be accepted and happy. This is nonsense! Happiness doesn’t come from accumulation. It doesn’t come from particular things. It doesn’t come from the outside. It comes from the inside. 

What if you live with someone? Aye yai yai, how can you be happy?! That person affects your life. You can’t be happy all of the time. “He left his socks in the middle of the bedroom floor! He expects me to pick them up! The nerve of him!” Maybe he doesn’t expect you to pick them up, maybe he just wants them left there!

“She washed her bras and hung them in the shower. I have to move them out of the way to take a shower! I don’t want to touch her bras!” No you don’t, but you have no problem touching her bra when being intimate.

All of these things add up to - I’m not happy. This person drives me crazy and is not making me happy. We aren’t compatible, maybe we should break up. I’m going to let you in on something - your happiness isn’t dependent on someone else, it is dependent upon you!

Would you be happy if that person wasn’t there? Would you miss their idiosyncrasies? No more socks on the floor or bras in the shower! But are you happy? Whether that person is there or not, you are still stuck with that person staring back at you in the mirror. You still have your fears, your loneliness, your confusion, your dissatisfaction. The answers to these problems are *inside of you*. You have to find these answers in the darkness. It can be daunting, frightening and intimidating, but when you discover them there is light and there is hope! Without these complications we can’t appreciate the goodness. Without fear we can’t appreciate bravery or courage. Without confusion we don’t appreciate clarity and without dispair we don’t appreciate love. 

*There is only one way to happiness and that way comes from you.*
