    Our household rounded the bend and started feeling better at the beginning of the week. I usually take a while longer to heal from things. It could be because of my age or autoimmune disease, but I know this to be the case and take it into consideration when I fall ill. My son is usually sick for a couple of days and begins to feel better and gets back in the swing of things after 3-4 days. This time it took him two weeks, and this was worrisome for me. Covid was a whole other game. We have been inside, except for a couple trips to the grocery store or for fast food, for over 2 weeks. This course of healing has taught me to listen to my body; it's taught me patience, and it's taught me to surrender. Surrendering to the situation isn't an act of weakness. It's an act of acceptance; it's an act of letting go - letting go of the need to be in control. Surrendering to God is similar, and there is one extra step: accepting what He wants you to do with your life. 

     During these two weeks, I read more, and I watched more movies, I wrote more, and I prayed more. I went inward after I surrendered outward. I remembered these words that my godmother, Auntie Mary, would say, "This too shall pass," and it did.

Stay safe, stay healthy, and keep the faith!
