What is love? A feeling? An action? A belief that encompasses your whole being? My definition of love is that it is a verb. When I give my whole self to you without any thought to my needs and happiness I have expressed myself in love. I believe that love is an art. It must be practiced in order to become better at it. And it is expressed to others in unique ways because of the individuality of the giver and the receiver. What is love for you?



These is one of the questions we’ll discuss in Love Class. Love Class is a 3 hour workshop for those 18 and over, exploring how love motivates us in life, how it deepens our relationships, and how we can show up in life when we begin with a foundation of love. After class, you will make mindset shifts, have deeper relationships, and move through this world with more confidence in your life’s purpose.
