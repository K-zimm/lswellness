You don’t have to be on the defense when it comes to your health. Take control of your health with these five steps.

1. *Schedule an annual exam.* Take advantage of the preventive services your insurance provides such as screenings for blood pressure, cancer, cholesterol, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. It also includes counseling to prevent health problems.

2. *Know your family history.* Does cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure or stroke run in your family? Make sure to tell your doctor which family members have/had these issues.

3. *Educate yourself about your health.* There are local and national support groups to help you with gathering and sorting information about a health problem and they can also make recommendations to doctors, clinics, counselors and lifestyle programs.

4. *Understand your insurance.* Read your insurance guidelines and understand what is covered and when to go to the emergency room vs. urgent care. You don’t want to be socked with a bill due to your own negligence.

5. *Create healthy habits.* Get enough sleep, keep hydrated, start and stay on a healthy diet, get enough physical activity and quit smoking.

Having health insurance is important but is no substitute for a healthy lifestyle!
