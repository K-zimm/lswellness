    My name is Lisa Strzoda (The "z" is silent, I knew you were wondering how to say it!) and I'm an AFPA Holistic nutritionist, owner of LS Wellness, LLC, Wellness Director of LIVEFIT WITH LUPUS and Vice President of the NCA-Quad Cities Celiac Group.

    I've learned to live a more active and vibrant life all the while living with three autoimmune diseases. I became passionate about my work when I began healing myself with whole food nutrition and healthy lifestyle changes and I can help you do the same.
