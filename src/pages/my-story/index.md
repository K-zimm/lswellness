I’ve lived with Celiac Disease, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and Fibromyalgia for 16 years and I’ve just added SIBO (Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth) to the group. Autoimmune disease affects 50 million people and there is no cure for it, but I’ve learned to live a full and active life in spite of it.

Eighteen years ago I had chronic migraines and was in bed 5 out of 7 days a week and had taken every prophylactic and abortive medication available. My sleep schedule was abysmaI and I also suffered from fatigue. I went to very reputable headache (Diamond Headache Clinic, Dr. Lawrence Robbins) and pain clinics (Dr. Michael Skaredoff) and was put on medications including Fentanyl for my joint pain and peripheral neuropathy. The Fentanyl alone cost \$1000 a month and I was on other medications on top of that. It was breaking our bank account. I would have much rather spent that money on something else. Even though these treatments (biofeedback and stress reduction techniques) were innovative at the time, I didn’t get any relief. It wasn’t until I went through a divorce and learned that stress and hormones were my primary triggers that I found some relief.

I knew the definition of autoimmune disease but didn’t understand all that it encompassed. I had learned bits and pieces about it over the years but not one of my doctors ever explained it to me, not even the one I was married to! I was told to go on a gluten free diet but no one explained how gluten causes inflammation and how it affects the gut of someone with celiac disease. So I was gluten free on and off for 14 years not realizing the damage I was doing to my gut and immune system.

It was not until I became involved with LIVEFIT WITH LUPUS and met people with other autoimmune diseases (AIDs) that I began to fully understand AIDs, and their effect on the body. I’ve learned how the immune system works when the body contracts a disease, how it runs other organs and when it is out of whack how it can really mess things up.

I know what you’re going through and can help you through the maze of diagnoses and treatments. I believe in taking an integrative approach to health. An approach that looks at diet as well as lifestyle, offers emotional support, and values spiritual growth and development as much as physical modifications.
