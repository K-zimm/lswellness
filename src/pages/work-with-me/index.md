heading1: Why do you need a health coach?
content1: >-
  Change is hard. Change is scary. Change is letting go of familiarity and taking a step into uncertainty. At times it's necessary and may come with frustration, contempt and indecision. According to medical intuitive Carolyn Myss, author of "Anatomy of the Spirit," "If we let go of things, our life is going to change. And reality is that we are actually more afraid of change than we are of death." A health coach helps guide you on this journey.

  You are ready for change. Do you know how I know this? Because you searched for a health coach. If you weren't ready to change your health or change your life, you wouldn't have turned on your computer, Googled "health coach" and found me. You have taken that leap, now let me help you take that first step on the road to optimal health.

  I became a health coach because I wanted to help those with autoimmune disease "navigate a new normal" in their lives. It can be overwhelming when you are first diagnosed, but it isn't the end of the world. Just the world as you know it now. I can help you balance diet and excercise and stay positive while starting this new journey.

  This is how I began to help others live an improved, vibrant and complete life with autoimmune disease.
